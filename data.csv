"“When you’re skiing and stop in the middle of a tree run, you start paying more attention. The same happens with photography: as I focus on what I’m framing through my lens, time expands. It morphs. It changes.” 

Emily Hopcian (@emilyhopcian) sat down with artist and athlete Sofía Mejía Llamas (@chacay.av) to hear about where skiing and photography come together in the mountains, mind, and body.

"Inspired by his previous ""Crossing"" in Iceland last fall, #OspreyAthlete Payson McElveen @paysonmcelveen has knocked another traverse off his list. With the help of Tasmanian endurance rider @oneflukeshot, Payson pieced together a 360 mile route across Tasmania that crescendoed in difficulty, beginning on the wild, largely uninhabited northwestern coast and concluded on the white sand beaches of the Bay of Fires after 32 hours and over 34,000 feet of climbing. 

The island brought him face-to-face with three Tiger Snakes, one of the most venomous on the planet, hundreds of wallabies and wombats, and the friendly locals of Tasmania's rural communities.

The forthcoming film, produced in conjunction with Joey Schusler and Thomas Woodson and edited by Aidan Haley, will premier at the 2023 Sea Otter Classic and aims to share stories far beyond the athletic achievement of this ride.

"For Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we’re proud to highlight Breast Cancer Prevention Partners (@bcppartners), a leading science-based advocacy organization whose work aims to eliminate cancer-causing exposure to toxic chemicals and radiation. 

Each year, Osprey partners with BCPP to support their Climb Against the Odds fundraiser, providing packs and sponsoring an employee to join their annual ascent of Mount Shasta in California. This year, #OspreyEmployee Erin Kuhlman (@erinkuhl93) took on the task, raising over $7,000 for their cause and writing about her experience along the way.

After all, if you can run, you can trail run.

"“… it was through an elementary school field trip that I first visited sequoias at a state park, and it provided an impressive memory that would seed a connection to the outdoors.” 

José González (@josebilingue), Founder of @LatinoOutdoors and #OspreyAmbassador, grappled with dual identities after immigrating from Mexico to the U.S. as a fourth grader. His relationship with the outdoors shifted in the States, eventually leading him on a path of cultural discovery.

Today, Latino Outdoors is a nonprofit that inspires, connects and engages Latine communities in the outdoors, ensuring their history, heritage and leadership are valued and represented.

"“It is a huge benefit to see yourself represented in anything you do. We just want to help people of color find their path.” - Phil Henderson @phil_henderson, Expedition Leader for @fullcircleeverest 

Until May 12, 2022, only eight Black climbers had ever summitted Mount Everest. On that day, that total nearly doubled as the Full Circle Expeditions team’s seven members made history: the first all-Black team to summit the world’s highest peak. 

In honor of their achievement and to support for their continued mission, we are donating 5% of our online sales from Sept. 30 – Oct. 6, up to $10,000, to Full Circle Expeditions. Gear up for the seasons ahead and help them with their goal to “inspire the next generation of outdoor enthusiasts, educators, leaders and mountaineers of color to continue chasing their personal summits.”

"The #Over50Outside cohort is warming up for summer hiking! These are the last few months this group of 150 women has to complete the @52hikechallenge. Last September, they committed to hiking once a week for an entire year. Will they be able to finish off 52 hikes over the next 3.5 months?
 
Our guess is YES! Here are just a few of the moments that so many of them are sharing online. Together, they’re hiking along desert vistas, through deep canyons, along coastal waters, and encouraging each other with in-person meetups and digital social hours.
 
Keep tabs on their journey by following #OutdoorResearch and #Over50Outside. And stay tuned for an extra special end-of-season event we’re cooking up. We can’t wait to see where these ladies explore next.

"Did you know that we’re proud members of @conservationalliance who recently announced the Dolores River in Colorado as one of their four Advocacy Priority Campaigns for 2022? Beginning high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado, it flows 230 miles until it joins the Colorado River in Utah’s red rock desert near Moab. McPhee Dam and Reservoir were built in the 1980’s to support the growing agricultural communities in the region, and to provide much-needed water for the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in Towaoc. 

This year, they will be joining groups advocating for protection of the lower Dolores River through:

💦  A bill to designate a 75,000-acre National Conservation Area spanning from the base of McPhee Reservoir to the San Miguel/Montrose County line, which includes more than 70 miles of the Dolores River, establishes the Ponderosa Gorge Roadless Area, and protects special river values.

They’re partnering with Dolores River Boating Advocates in the effort to protect this beautiful river and surrounding lands.
